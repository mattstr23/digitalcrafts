State is a place that we can store/hold data.
The process of passing state to another component is called props.
Local state is only available to that specific file, global is when its been passed down to another file from a higher level.
We store state in functional components using hooks.

useState - const[statename, setstatename] = usestate()
Using the setstate, the state will always become whatever you want it to be.
