#We see how a dictionary is a more complex data type
#We see that we can access values inside of a dictionary if we refer to a key that is in the dictionary
#We see that dictionaries can contain many different data types.
    #[], (), "", {}, int, boolean, float, loops, for statements
#We can access specific methods that are designed for dictionaries (such as .items)
#VARIABLE["NEWKEY"] and then we can assign it a value
#We can use the keyword del to delete a key or value from a dictionary
