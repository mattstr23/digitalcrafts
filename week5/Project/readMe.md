#ValiFit

ValiFit is my 4 page Front-End project for DigitalCrafts.
Uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM Manipulation, and APIs

Features a NavBar for easy navigation from page to page.
Also mobile responsive on every page.

Opens with a main page with some general info on fitness and health

Top Nav bar has 4 links, a Workouts page, a Meals page, and a Links Page. With the ValiFit header on the left always taking you back to the main home page.

Workout Page uses 10 clickable buttons with a differnt body part on each button. Once one is clicked, it will pull from ExerciseDB API to populate an exercise 
with name, a gif animation of the workout, and equipment needed for the workout. This can be done with any of the buttons, and clears any previous selction.
(Side note: This API is free up to a limit so it has a limited use)

Meals page has a clickable Broccoli image that will generate 4 recipes at random that are under 750 calories. These recipes pull from spoonacular API. 
The recipes will have a name, image, and links to the recipe itself and links to similar recipes. 
Each click will populate new recipes, clearing out the previous ones.
(Side note: This API is free up to a limit so it has a limited use)

Links page is a hyperlink page using images of people, blogs, video channels to link a user to those pages with more info on health and fitness. 
These are just some known sites and places I've used in the past with good resources.
