# CSS "containers" over elements
- 3 containers on almost every html element.
- margin is the outermost container
- border is the next that inside tmargin but outside padding
- padding is the innermost but outside the content

# CSS Position
- Position: absolute, fixed, relative, static

# CSS Flexbox
- 'display: flex;' is how you call it
- Flexbox is a tool we can use to control the layout of a website
- It can figure all the spacing math for me
- Pros: Simple and very short to get your desired effect
        Works really well with mutliple columns
- Cons: Syntax can be tough to understand
        Not great at single column layouts
- By default it wants to organize everything in a row, not a column
- Many options and changes you can make, definitely check out google
